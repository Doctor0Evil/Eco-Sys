# Contributing to Eco‑Sys

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Eco‑Sys! This project enforces strict **nonfiction** and **energy‑compliance** standards.

---

## Standards

All contributions must:

1. **Pass SHA‑512 validation** — Code must be cryptographically signed
2. **Include Typewriter metadata** — Authorship and timestamp required
3. **Demonstrate energy efficiency** — Show measurable power reduction or maintain baseline
4. **Anchor to Googolswarm** — Commits must be ALN‑registered
5. **Zero fictional output** — No placeholders, TODOs, or simulated data in production code

---

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make changes following Rust best practices
4. Run tests: `cargo test`
5. Generate energy report: `cargo run -- energy-plan`
6. Commit with signed authorship:
   ```bash
   git commit -S -m "feat: your feature description"
Push and open a pull request

Code Style
Rust: Follow rustfmt and clippy recommendations

Comments: Explain why, not what

Tests: Required for all new functions

Documentation: Update README and ARCHITECTURE.md if applicable

Authorship
Include your DID in commit metadata:

```text
[authors]
name = "Your Name"
did = "your-blockchain-did"
